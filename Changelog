Changelog -

	- Started the blackjack card enum classes
	- Google "How to program with java" card enum for exmaple of
		what I'm doing
	- Finished the Card.java file for the most part

	To do next:
	- Create the Value.java file and create the enum inside
	- Create the Suit.java file and create the enum inside
	- Create Deck.java class that creates the deck, adds it
		to the stack. If we use the proper array, we can 
		use collections.shuffle to shuffle the deck 		
		hopefully 
	- Add package acade; to the top of ALL files to make sure enums
		work correctly
