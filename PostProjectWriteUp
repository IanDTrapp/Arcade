Arcade - Projet 4

Overview:
	
	We designed our Arcade program to run less like a flash game type applet, and more like a full screen game application. 
	In an attempt to make it an pain free and game centered experience that could emulate modern Windows applications. Both
	games act and feel as a user should expect them to, and both are very intuitive with large, easily labeled buttons. It
	should feel modern and fluid, but not too flashy and painful on the eye.  


Design: 

	We have a menu bar that allows a player to return to the main menu and exit the game from anywhere, allowing you to 
	transition from game to game without completely exiting the application. This also allows scores to be preserved
	universally throughout the application. Both games contain scoreboards for games since start up, accessible through 
	the screen where you actually play the game. 

	In Tic Tac Toe, we provide the user with large pressable buttons to represent spaces. This works well via mouse interaction
	and also via touchscreen interaction, making it feel like a modern Windows 8 or mobile application adapted for a larger 
	screen. We provide the score on either side of the screen so that users may keep track of their scoring as they play. 

	In Black Jack, the user has a screen with the dealer's cards on top and the player's cards on the bottom. The user is 
	presented with 3 buttons: Hit, Stand, and Split. Split is only clickable when splitting is actually an available option 
	(where the first two cards are of the same value. This splits the deck in to two, with the same set of buttons splitting
	and occuring for both hands. 

Functionality:

	In Tic Tac Toe, the user presses a button to choose that space. Upon pressing that button, their symbol is added to the 
	button and the button is made unclickable. When a game is won, their win is added to the scoreboard and they are 
	prompted to start a new game or exit to the main menu.
